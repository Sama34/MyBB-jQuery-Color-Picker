Note: You have to use the correct identifiers, there are tons you can use and the ones below are just to get your brain on the thought process,  also note that for some items you might also need also to remove image attributes from the css on the respective items else some elements with such it may not work properly...

Anyhoo, as you see you can think of and come up with all sorts elements to specific color/style and ways to use such....

table a:link, .top_links a:link, a:link, a:hover, a:focus, a:visited, #panel .lower ul.panel_links a:link, #panel .lower ul.panel_links  a:visited, #panel .lower ul.panel_links a:hover, #panel .lower ul.panel_links a:active, #panel .lower ul.user_links a:link, #panel .lower ul.user_links  a:visited, #panel .lower ul.user_links a:hover, #panel .lower ul.user_links a:active, #footer a:link, #footer a:visited, #footer a:hover, #footer a:active

.thead, .tfoot, #search input.button, .postbit_buttons > a:link

#panel, .tfoot, .upper, .thead, .tcat, #footer, #copyright, .breadcrumb, #header

.post_block h3, .post_block h3 a, .trow1 a:link, .trow2 a:link, #logo ul.top_links a:link, #panel .lower a:link, .navigation a:link


Etc, etc, .....


Changes:

- changed version numbering as it made more sense rather than be reflective of software version and saying hey the plugin is on 1.8 so plug version is 1.8? Instead factoring that initial version should be factored as version 1, then, my initial conversions begin thus @ 1.1 and finalized as 1.2 as it made more sense to me and should be such as to not confuse from previous project as this with various changes and dependency removals changes is now diff project...

- added the old touch specific files I shared back in 2016 tutorial this was based on

- replaced dark version of picker with the light coloured version

- removed the dependency on plugin library by writing those specific parts to be standalone for the plugin to be used without such a need (as that sort of thing bugs me when folks say hey, here is this plug you should use, but, wait, you first need another plug/library in order to use the plug, grrr, while plenty prefer standalone, or leave it alone, lol)

- began implementing localization support (localization is currently in place for English, EnglishGB, Espanol, French, Italiano)
